# Rhythmletics
Rhythmletics was going to be a racing game that revolved around running, each runner has to follow arrow movements DDR style to keep up speed. 

This was an attempt at implementing Steamworks in Godot using https://github.com/Facepunch/Facepunch.Steamworks and Flatbuffers https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/

Packets were constructed using Flatbuffers and sent over Steam
